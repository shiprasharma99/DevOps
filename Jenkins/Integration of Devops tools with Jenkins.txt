CI/CD pipeline intheir company.You havebeenaskedtoimplementthislifecycle asfast as
possible. Asthisis a product-based company, their product is available on this GitHub link.
https://github.com/hshar/website.git
Following are the specifications of the Continuous integration:
1. Git Workflow has to be implemented
2. Code Build should automatically be triggered once commit is made to master branch 
or develop branch.
If commit is made to master branch, build and publish website on 
port 82. If commit is made to develop branch, just build the 
product, do not publish.
3. Create a pipeline for the above tasks.
4. Create a container with Ubuntu and apache installed in it and use that container to
build the code and the code should be on ‘/var/www/html’
