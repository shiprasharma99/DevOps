Module-8: Jenkins Assignment - 1 
You have been asked to: 
● Trigger a pipeline using Git when push on Develop branch 
● Pipeline should pull git content to a folder


git init

touch 1.txt

git add .

git commit -m "commiting to master"

git checkout -b develop master

vi touch

create and connect an ubuntu ec2 instance

inside the terminal, run

1. sudo su
2. apt-get update -y
3. apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk -y
4. wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | apt-key add -
5. sh -c 'echo deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > \ e>
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'
6. apt-get update -y

Install Jenkins
7. sudo apt-get install jenkins -y

Now http://ip-address-of-my-ec2-user:8080

sign up to jenkins, save new credential, and install suggested plugins

install maven plugin and integrate it with github by pating the github url in the source code management

copy the github url of the forked repository and clone it to the local system

create a freestyle project in jenkins named "git-jen"
edit the branch to develop, so that jenkins can only monitor the changes on the specific develop branch 

in source code management, paste the github url and click on build now

in ec2 instance
use git remote add origin github url

git push -u origin master

login to github
go to webhooks

click add webhooks
go to payload URL and add 
http://ip-address-of-my-ec2-server:8080/github-webhook/

now go to jenkins
paste the github repo(forked as my own) in source code management

and in build triggers click on the Github hook trigger for GITScm polling

i have integrated jenkins and github with each other, now with every change in the code, jenkins will take its own build

to pull the Git content to a folder using the Maven checkout goal.
mvn checkout scm:checkout -DcheckoutDirectory=my-folder/
