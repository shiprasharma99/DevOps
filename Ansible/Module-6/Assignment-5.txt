Module-6: Ansible Assignment - 5 
You have been asked to: 
● Create a new deployment of ansible cluster of 5 nodes 
● Label 2 nodes as test and other 2 as prod 
● Install java on test nodes 
● Install mysql-server on prod nodes 
Use Anisble roles for the above, group the hosts under test and prod


Create an inventory file to define the target hosts and group them as test and prod:

[test]
test_node_1
test_node_2

[prod]
prod_node_1
prod_node_2

Create a role called ansible-java to install Java on test nodes
i defined the tasks for installing Java in ansible-java/tasks/main.yml as follows:

---
- name: Install Java
  become: true
  apt:
    name: default-jdk
    state: present

Create another role called ansible-mysql to install MySQL on prod nodes
i defined the tasks for installing MySQL in ansible-mysql/tasks/main.yml as follows:

---
- name: Install MySQL Server
  become: true
  apt:
    name: mysql-server
    state: present

Create a playbook called deployment.yml to deploy the roles on the target hosts based on the group
i defined the playbook as follows:

---
- name: Deploy roles
  hosts: all
  become: true
  roles:
    - { role: ansible-java, when: "'test' in group_names" }
    - { role: ansible-mysql, when: "'prod' in group_names" }

Finally, i executed the playbook using the ansible-playbook command as follows:

ansible-playbook -i <path-to-inventory-file> deployment.yml
